# Project Tasks

## 1. **Setup & Base Configuration**

1. [x] **Initialize the project repository**

   - Set up a Next.js 15 project (using the new App Router if desired)
   - Configure Tailwind CSS (including dark mode support if required)
   - Install and configure Storybook in the project
   - Install ShadCN UI components (or replicate their structure for UI)
   - Configure ESLint and TypeScript in strict mode

2. [x] **Set up global theming and Tailwind config**

   - Create a tailwind.config.js (or .ts) file that extends default tokens (colors, spacing, etc.)
   - Ensure dark mode toggling is implemented (e.g., toggling a dark class on <html>)

3. [x] **Create a base Storybook layout**
   - Create a Storybook decorator that wraps each story in a container with a header (for theme toggling and navigation)
   - Include the viewport addon in Storybook to test desktop and basic mobile responsiveness

## 2. **User Authentication (Clerk)**

1. [x] **Install and configure Clerk**

   - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY in your .env or environment variables
   - Wrap the Next.js root layout or \_app with Clerk's <ClerkProvider>

2. [x] **Create SignIn and SignUp pages**

   - Use Clerk's <SignIn /> and <SignUp /> components to quickly scaffold auth pages
   - Validate that new users can register and existing users can sign in

3. [x] **Storybook stories for auth states**
   - Logged Out State
     - Mock the user as null or undefined, ensuring the sign-in form is displayed
   - Logged In State
     - Mock a user object (e.g., { id: "user_1", email: "user@example.com" }) to show a welcome message

##3. **Dashboard Page (PDF Upload & Processing)** 1. [ ] **Create a Dashboard page/component**
• Add a file input that accepts .pdf files.
• Include a button labeled "Upload PDF" (or similar). 2. [ ] **Integrate pdf-parse to extract text**
• On file selection, parse the PDF's text content in a Next.js API route or via a Convex function.
• Store the returned text in state for display. 3. [ ] **Display processing states**
• Show a spinner and a "Processing PDF..." message while parsing.
• Display the extracted data once parsing completes. 4. [ ] **Storybook stories for the Dashboard**
• Empty State
• No file selected, show "No PDF uploaded."
• File Selected
• Mock a file name like "invoice_sample.pdf" but do not show extracted text yet.
• Processing
• Show a loading spinner and text "Processing PDF..."
• Extraction Result
• Display a mock JSON block:

{
"Invoice Number": "INV-001",
"Date": "2023-01-01",
"Total": "$100.00"
}

##4. **Training Page (Classification & Data Extraction)** 1. [ ] **Create a Training page/component**
• Divide the layout: left side for uploading/training example selection, right side for annotation or metadata. 2. [ ] **Implement PDF upload for training**
• Accept a text-based PDF.
• Parse it with pdf-parse (same or similar pipeline as the Dashboard). 3. [ ] **Annotation UI**
• Render the extracted text in a scrollable container.
• Implement text highlighting and a popup or inline editor to label selected text (e.g., "Invoice Number"). 4. [ ] **Save annotation data**
• Store mapping of labeled fields to text segments (start index, end index, label).
• Provide a "Save Training Example" button that sends these annotations to a backend or Convex function. 5. [ ] **Storybook stories for Training page**
• Empty State
• Show "No training examples uploaded."
• Training Example Uploaded
• Display a file name (e.g., "training_invoice.pdf") plus extracted text.
• Annotation In Progress
• Mock selecting "INV-001" as highlighted text with a label input "Invoice Number."
• Saved Training Example
• Display a summary of the saved annotations in JSON format.

##5. **Convex Integration (Data Storage & Serverless Functions)** 1. [ ] **Configure Convex in the project**
• Initialize a Convex project with npx convex init.
• Update .env with the CONVEX_URL or configure using environment variables. 2. [ ] **Create functions for PDF metadata & extracted text**
• In convex/ directory, write a function to store PDF metadata (fileName, fileSize, etc.).
• Write a function to store extracted text and link it to the PDF record. 3. [ ] **Create functions for training examples**
• Store the classification label (e.g., "Invoice") and annotated fields in the Convex DB.
• Write a function to list, update, or delete training examples. 4. [ ] **Storybook "mocks" or tests for Convex**
• Upload Pending
• Show a loading spinner with the text "Uploading to Convex...".
• Upload Success
• Display a success message with the mock metadata:

{ "fileId": "file_123", "fileName": "invoice_sample.pdf" }

    •	Upload Error
    •	Show an error message: "Upload failed, please try again."

##6. **Classification & Data Extraction API** 1. [ ] **Create a classification endpoint**
• In a Next.js API route (e.g., /api/classify), accept extracted text as input.
• Return a JSON object with a documentType (e.g., "Invoice") and a confidence score. 2. [ ] **Create an extraction endpoint**
• In /api/extract, accept documentType and text.
• Leverage the user's training data to find relevant fields (e.g., "Invoice Number", "Date", "Total"). 3. [ ] **Storybook or mock states**
• Classification API Response
• Mock:

{ "documentType": "Invoice", "confidence": 0.95 }

    •	Extraction API Response
    •	Mock:

{
"Invoice Number": "INV-001",
"Date": "2023-01-01",
"Total": "$100.00"
}

##7. **Annotation Component** 1. [ ] **Build a standalone Annotation component**
• Display a block of text.
• Handle text selection and highlight the selected range. 2. [ ] **Label assignment**
• On highlight release, open a small input (e.g., a popover) prompting "Enter label."
• Save the selection indices and label in local state. 3. [ ] **Display saved annotations**
• Render them differently (e.g., underlined or highlighted in a distinct color).
• Offer a tooltip on hover that shows the assigned label. 4. [ ] **Storybook stories**
• Raw Text Display
• Show "Invoice Number: INV-001" with no highlights.
• Text Selected
• The substring "INV-001" is highlighted.
• Label Input Open
• A popover or inline editor with placeholder text "Invoice Number."
• Annotation Saved
• The highlight remains, and local state contains:

{ "start": 16, "end": 23, "label": "Invoice Number" }

##8. **Navigation (Dashboard & Training)** 1. [ ] **Create a shared NavBar or Sidebar**
• Use ShadCN components for a stylish, accessible navigation bar.
• Provide links for "Dashboard" and "Training." 2. [ ] **Configure routing**
• Use Next.js App Router or file-based routing to switch between /dashboard and /training.
• Ensure the nav highlights the current page. 3. [ ] **Storybook stories**
• Dashboard Active
• Simulate a selected state for "Dashboard," other links inactive.
• Training Active
• Simulate a selected state for "Training."

##9. **Error Handling & Loading States** 1. [ ] **Implement error boundaries**
• Wrap critical areas like PDF parsing, classification calls, and annotation saving with error boundaries (or try-catch in serverless routes). 2. [ ] **Provide loading indicators**
• Add spinners or skeleton UIs for network calls (uploading PDFs, hitting the classification API, etc.). 3. [ ] **Storybook stories for errors/loading**
• Loading State
• For PDF upload, display "Loading..." plus a spinner.
• Extraction Error
• Show "Error: Unable to extract text from PDF."
• Annotation Error
• Show "Error: Annotation could not be saved. Please try again."

##10.** End-to-End Flow Simulation** 1. [ ] **Integrate all components**
• Ensure Dashboard (upload, parse) → classification → extraction → results.
• Ensure Training (upload example, annotate) → store data → confirm or edit. 2. [ ] **User flow**
• Login: Clerk manages session state.
• Upload PDF: e.g., "invoice_sample.pdf".
• Classify: Return documentType = "Invoice".
• Extract: Return fields:

{
"Invoice Number": "INV-001",
"Date": "2023-01-01",
"Total": "$100.00"
}

    •	Train: Save annotated fields from training PDF to refine the model.

    3.	[ ] **Storybook "End-to-End Workflow"**
    •	Show a sequence of steps: logged-in state, file selection, classification result, extraction result, and training example annotation.
